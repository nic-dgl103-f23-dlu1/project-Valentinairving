    <p>The Comox Valley Lifeline Society is a non-profit, charitable organization that provides Lifeline services to a variety of individuals who may feel reassured that help is available to them twenty four hours a day, seven days a week.

        The Society was established in 1988 by the 'Lions of the North Island' because the membership believed that people deserved the dignity to live on their own and have access to immediate help in an emergency situation.</p>
