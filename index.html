    <h3>What is Lifeline?</h3>
    <p>Lifeline is an easy-to-use personal emergency response system that lets you summon help any time of the day or night, even if you can't speak.  All you have to do is press your Personal Help Button, worn on a wristband or pendant and a Personal Response Associate will ensure you get help fast.</p>

    <h3>Live independently at home with Lifeline Medical Alert Service</h3>
    <p>This year 1.4 million people, 65 and older will fall.  If you or a loved one experience a medial emergency, time is of the essence.  We can help by connecting you to the right help for the situation, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year at the push of a button.  Whether you need emergency services or just the assistance of a family member or friend to help you get back on your feet, we can help.</p>
    <h3>If a fall should happen</h3>
    <p>Not all falls can be prevented.  If a fall does occur, older adults need to be sure they can reach help easily and quickly, especially if they are injured, in order to prevent further injury and dangerous complications.



        The Comox Valley Lifeline Society offers a variety of medical alert services designed specifically for older adults that provide fast, 24/7 access to expert help in an emergency.  These services range from the standard HomeSafe service to the fall detection capability of the HomeSafe with AutoAlert and the freedom of the new GoSafe mobile service.</p>
